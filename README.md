# Dedeepya-K-Task-Tracker--using-angular
An simple task tracker application built using Angular JS.

Angular is an application design framework and development platform ffor creating efficient and sophisticated single page apps.
In this project we will build a simple angular based application- "Task Tracker" using concepts of components and services offered by Angular.

We will have six components inside our appplication which are as follows:

1. Header
2. open/close button (A reusable button component)
3. Add task component (To add a new task)
4. Task component - Each individual task is it's own component
5. Footer
6. Router - To move through the about page and home page.


### Angular CLI 
Angular CLI(Command Line Interface) is a standard tooling for angular apps. It provides direct commands to generate componeents, services etc.,.
The command to globally install angular cli is as follows:

#### npm install -g @angular/cli

Once the CLI is ready now we can start building our angular application. Use the following command to create a new app by name AngularCrashCourse.

#### ng new AngularCrashCourse
